# _RICK RUN_: moving diner 4 the dead
## Project Two: Life in the Front End

```
A horrible disease outbreak has overtaken much of the world and turned ordinary people into zombies. As the zombie population grows, they have found that they have nowhere to eat. Your friend Rick sees an amazing business opportunity to feed all of these zombies and creates a diner. Rick needs to get the word out, so he wants to create a web application to host his menu (they're undead, but it's also the 21st century).
```

- This project takes the idea of a food truck to the next level. 
- It offers an enticing menu to the zombies.
- It's mobile in case the zombies decide Rick looks more delicious. So pick something off the menu and not the chef!
- Check out the feature_specs.md for the site features.

- have the categories toggle visibility of dishes on click 
- have the image show up on side upon click of dish title
- keypress event to show all editing features
- update css 
- have keypress trigger zombies chasing truck or climbing all over it
